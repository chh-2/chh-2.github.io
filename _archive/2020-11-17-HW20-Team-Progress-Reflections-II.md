## Reflections

If it felt like we weren't working fast enough before, then it's impressive to see what we've accomplished in the past two weeks since the last reflection blog post. From 5 test cases and one working driver to 5 mostly working drivers and getting the reporting scripts working. We've discussed several changes to how the code will be organized, some of which I think we'll implement and some which I don't think we will. I feel like everyone has really stepped up now: we're meeting 3 times each week to touch base and make progress, sometimes working together on one piece of the project and sometimes just working side-by-side in silence (well, as much as we can from online). It felt really intimidating approaching STEM for the first time, but I feel like I've started to understand it a lot more recently, and I see these same sparks of understanding from everyone else in the group as well. I didn't understand exactly what we were doing with drivers at first, or how to get the dependencies from STEM, or how to build our own project around this large complex piece of code. I still can't say I fully understand all aspects of it, but I definitely understand it a lot more than I did at the beginning of the semester. With half a month left in the semester, I can say that I'm proud of my group and the progress we've made working on this project.
