## 11.4 What is the common characteristic of all architectural styles that are geared to supporting software fault tolerance?


## 11.7 It has been suggested that the control software for a radiation therapy machine, used to treat patients with cancer, should be implemented using N-version programming. Comment on whether or not you think this is a good suggestion.


## 11.9 Explain why you should explicitly handle all exceptions in a system that is intended to have a high level of availability.


## 12.5 A train protection system automatically applies the brakes of a train if teh speed limit for a segment of track is exceeded, or if the trian enters a track segment that is currently signaled with a red light (i.e., the segment should not be entered). There are two critical-safety requirements for this train protection system: The train shall not enter a segment of track that is signaled with a red light, and The train shall not exceed the specified speed limit for a section of track. Assuming that the signal status and the speed limit for the track segment are transmitted to on-board software on the train before it enters the track segment, propose five possible functional system requirements for the onbaord software that may be generated from the system safety requirements.
