diff -u is much more readable, especially for someone unfamiliar with the code or if larger changes are made. Even for smaller changes, I think if someone was unfamiliar with the code then a basic diff command could be hard for them to parse in a meaningful way.

The configure and make commands failed when I tried to run them, so I was unable to test this change.
