## 24.6 Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for discovering errors in a program. What types of error are unlikely to be discovered through inspections?

Program inspections are basically a peer review for code, and peer reviews are useful in a wide range of subjects for helping the author or designer of a work to see errors they might have overlooked since they are so familiar with the project. It is easy for someone who is intimately involved with a project to overlook small details or discrepancies because their mind simply fills in the blanks after they have been working on it for long enough, so it is important for someone new to come in with fresh eyes to see where things don't make sense or where documentation may be lacking. Especially with the use of a checklist or similar to help search for common bugs, this can be an effective technique for discovering errors. Additionally, program inspections complement testing in a way that doesn't require the code to be run.

Despite these benefits, there may be an added cost that is perceived to outweigh any potential benefits. This type of inspection also may not catch all errors. Certain types of run-time errors may be able to escape detection from this technique, especially if code relies on unpredictable user inputs or if complicated processing is taking place.
