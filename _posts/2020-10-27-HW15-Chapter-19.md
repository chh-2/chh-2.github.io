## 19.3 Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from the properties of the system components?  

Just as computers themselves are synergistic systems, so too are complex software systems. Synergy is commonly understood as something that is greater than the sum of its parts. There may be functionalities of a system that only become useful once the components are integrated together, or system behaviors that affect speed, reliability, or other metrics of performance. Software systems have dependencies on hardware components just as much as software components, even though we don't think about these as much now that many services are hosted in the cloud. Individual software components need to interact nicely because an error from one may pass along to others and eventually break a system, even if the error or exception was handled properly when it initially arose. Errors must also be accounted for from operators and maintainers of systems, especially from new users, non tech savvy users, or when new updates to major functionality or interfaces are implemented. And each of these factors affects one another in complex and unpredictable ways. When you introduce something that advances as quickly as technology to something as unpredictable as people, there are entirely new layers that must be considered in the design, operation, and upkeep of complex systems.
