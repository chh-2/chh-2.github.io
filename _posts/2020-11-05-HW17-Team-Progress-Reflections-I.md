## Reflections

Our team has already come a long way from the beginning of the semester. There were some issues getting the code running initially that affected some group members more than others, and there were some issues with meeting to get deliverables done on time, but we've started to pull things together more. We've started meeting 2-3 times a week most weeks to work on the project and it finally feels like we're making steady progress. I think there were some misunderstandings of the project requirements earlier on, but I think we're finally getting that on track as well.

We've divided the work so that everyone is working on a driver and work is balanced between documentation and working on other pieces of code, but we all help each other out where necessary. There are no explicitly defined goals in our group, but we've fallen into a natural pace with good communication and responsibility sharing among the four of us. When I first joined Team 4, we were still looking at evaluating Martus, and it feels like we should be making more progress to be 2-3 months into the semester, but at the same time it's easier to see how the project is starting to come together more and more and it feels like we'll be able to get where we need to by the end of the semester.
