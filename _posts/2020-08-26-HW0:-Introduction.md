Hello. At the time of writing, I'm a senior at the College of Charleston majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in purusing a career in Cyber Security after graduation, hopefully staying in the Charleston area. I've interned in the Cyber Security departments of both MUSC and Santee Cooper, with a large part of my experience being in email security. I'll be updating this blog regularly throughout the semester, so check here to see what I'm up to in Software Engineering, Fall 2020.
