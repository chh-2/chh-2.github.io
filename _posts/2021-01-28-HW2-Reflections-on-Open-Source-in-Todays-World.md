title: "Reflections on Open Source in Today's World"
---

For today’s blog, I found three related posts on opensource.com that relate to different stages along the Open-Source Contributors pipeline. The first two, “4 Big Lessons from My Internship with Open Source” and “My First Contribution to Open Source: Imposter Syndrome” recount the experiences of two individuals beginning their open-source journeys. Jaideep and Galen both have their first exposure to the common “you should contribute to open-source” while in college, and neither knew exactly what to do with this information. Galen in particular notes the potential harm in common phrases if they aren’t contextualized: “‘Anyone can do this,’ insisted the post, ‘and it is a crucial part of participating in the larger developer community.’” Galen expands on this by recounting how she was overwhelmed by git, and how she internalized these simple comments into a self-perpetuating cycle of “I can’t contribute because I’m not a real developer; I won’t be a real developer until I can contribute.”  

Jaideep had a different experience in that his foray into open source involved joining a team where everyone else was also new to the particular challenge his team was addressing. Whenever the imposter syndrome would begin setting in, Jaideep was able to look around at other people struggling with the exact same situation and feel less alone, making it easier to remember that “pitting myself (an intern working part time) against industry veterans wasn't really a fair comparison for anyone.” Without this immediate presence of others and the opportunity to see them struggle first-hand, it is easy to feel like you’re the only one who isn’t up to speed or doesn’t understand.  

The third article I read was titled “10 Tips for Onboarding Open-Source Contributors.” This article contrasts the previous two by explaining what the leaders of an open-source project can do to facilitate new developers and the transition to learning the project and getting contributions. Specifically, this article provides an overview of the experience of a non-profit called Ushahidi—its rise, its fall, and its path to redemption. Ushahidi went from having a really involved community to inadvertently withdrawing from that community when significant upgrades were made and money got tighter. This led to difficulties onboarding new contributors because documentation made during this phase was unstructured and unclear.  

Just a few of the 10 points addressed in this article are “Make ‘getting started’ clear,” “Be kind in code reviews,” and “Be responsive.” While some of the other points like evaluating processes and setting foundations are necessary and will help a project to have direction and thrive, I chose to highlight these three points because these are the things that Jaideep and Galen either said did or would have helped them. I can second this, as a computer science student who is contributing to open source for the first time as a part of this class and was vaguely overwhelmed by the whole process (the idea of the process was honestly more daunting than beginning the process itself, thanks to finding a well-structured and well-supported project).  

Clarity in getting started takes away so many levels of stress; when you can just copy and dabble in the code without having to ask anyone and let them know you’re getting involved before you know if they even need any contributions within your scope and skill level. Being responsive is encouraging to new potential contributors. Either they can get a feel for the community through responses to others, or they feel heard and recognized just by being directly acknowledged in a timely manner. Lastly, being kind in code reviews provides a little boost to a contributor who may have been extremely anxious to make that pull request. In the stressful state of the world today and record levels of anxiety at a near-global scale, a little kindness can go a long way towards expanding someone’s comfort zone, as they familiarize themselves with a completely new world of code.
