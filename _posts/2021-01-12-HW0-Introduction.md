**Name:** Chloe Harris  
**Major:** Computer Science, B.S.  
**Minor(s):** Sociology, Math  
**Graduation Date:** May 2021  

At the time of writing, I'm a senior at the College of Charleston majoring in Computer Science. I'm interested in purusing a career in Cyber Security after graduation, hopefully staying in the Charleston area. I've interned in the Cyber Security departments of both MUSC and Santee Cooper, with a large part of my experience being in email security. Vim > Nano
